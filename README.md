# travis-web-check

THis is a quirk and dirty test repository for hte moment, but I have a few goals. The typos in the previous sentence were intentional to test some things, as is the following bad link:
http://deadlink.google.com

I have a habit of creating documentation-heavy projects in git. Travis CI seems like a tool that could be useful for linting HTML (and Markdown, CSS, javascript, etc), running spell check, looking for dead links, etc. Once I've figured all that out (as I'm writing this I'm new to Travis), I'll have a nice little template in this repo that can be used elsewhere. For now, this is basically a dummy file to check for errors in.
